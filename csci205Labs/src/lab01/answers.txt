(2.1) Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. 

(2.2) Local Version Control Systems(Example: Used in a system called RCS(Revision Control System), Centralized Version Control Systems (Example: GIT- used to collaborate with developers on other systems), Distributed Version Control Systems (Example:Use to fully mirror the repository and are useful for restoring repositories in case as server dies)

(2.3) Git is a Distributed Version Control System

(2.4) Git operations only need local files and resources to operate – generally no information is needed from another computer on your network. This is a beneficial feature because it provides it makes the system very fast and we have the entire history of the project right there on our local disk.This also allows us to most work even when we're offline. 

(2.5)The mechanism that Git uses is called a SHA-1 hash. This is a 40-character string composed of hexadecimal characters (0–9 and a–f) and calculated based on the contents of a file or directory structure in Git.
Git stores everything in its database not by file name but by the hash value of its contents and hence, we can find hashvalues everywhere. 

(2.6) Git has three main states that files can reside in: committed, modified, and staged. Committed means that the data in stored in the local database for anytime access and is very secure. Modified allows the data to be changed but not cully committed to the database. Staged means that the modified file has been marked in its current version for the next committed snapshot. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

(3.1) The IDE invokes the Java programming language compiler (javac), which takes your source file and translates its text into instructions that the Java virtual machine can understand. These instructions are called bytecodes.

(3.2) The advances in compiler and virtual machine technologies are bringing performance close to that of native code without threatening portability which makes JVM better than native code. 

(3.3) As a platform-independent environment, the Java platform can be a bit slower than native code.

(3.4) The article assumes that Java learners are familiar with C or C++. This i snot true for someone like me and hence, it might take longer for me to understand the coding practices and the skills in Java. 

(3.5) a.) // this is a single-line comment
      b.) /* This could be a multi-line comment */
      c.) /** This is a javadoc comment */

(3.6) compile - $ javac MyProgram.java
      run - $ java MyProgram
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(4.1) Prints a String and then terminates the line. This method behaves as though it invokes print(String) and then println().

(4.2) The object 'in' is the "standard" input stream. It's a static type of InputStream
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(5.1) The answer was 1 and not 1.5 because the input was integer values which results in the answer not rounding up or giving float and decimal answers but instead goes to the nearest smallest integer. 

(5.2) The answer is 1.5 because the final result has been assigned double time and hence, it will give a decimal answer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(6.1) The method takes an argument called args of type String array.

(6.2) the void keyword indicates that the method does not return anything to the caller.

(6.3) Identifiers are abbreviations or names used to represent a particular variable, class or method. An identifier can contain both lowercase and uppercase characters, digits, underscore character and the Dollar sign. An identifier can be of any length and cannot start with a digit. An identifier cannot have the same name as Java language keyword, a boolean literal and a null literal. 

(6.4) Keywords are special words in Java that have special meanings and are reserved for certain purposes such as main, static, void etc.

(6.5) Both double and float data types represent a floating point number but a double can store approximately twice the number of significant digits as type float.

(6.6) The byte, short, int and long variables are all primitive data types. 'byte' occupies a single byte of memory and can hold values in range of -128 to 127. 
'short' stores a signed numeric value in two bytes
'int' stores a signed numeric value in four bytes
'long' stores a signed numeric value in eight bytes

(6.7) String is not a primitive data type in Java. It is a class in Java.

(6.8) String name = "Anushikha Sharma" ;

(6.9) The scope of a variable is decided by its position in the program code. The scope indicates the lifetime of a variable.
